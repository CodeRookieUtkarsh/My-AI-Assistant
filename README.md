# My-AI-Assistant

This is my AI Assistant named UDA.
This is capable of doing multiple tasks, unique and main ones being telling news headlines from trusted international sources and opening different kinds of apps (In my computer. In yours, u will have to customise it).
It is capable of taking a screenshot, copying some text to your clipboard, emails, search something on google, restart, hibernate, or shutdown your computer and remember things you tell me to remember, play some songs, and tell you some jokes.
Finally, it can do some things that are very common. Like, it can tell you the date, time, your cpu and battery percentage, calculate some math problems, tell you about celebrities, and search something in wikipedia.
